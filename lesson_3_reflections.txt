When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

For collaborative, open source work and projects which I wish to show to eventual employers.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

You might not always want the latest version, you also don't want
to get your work destroyed if a new commit comes on remote repository
and overwrites yours.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

Fork is a clone from github profile to another github profile that
references the fact that it's forked and increases fork count of original
creator. Branch is something else entirely.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?

It's a base to work on, if you only ever had one, old state of a remote
half of your code could be not actual.
