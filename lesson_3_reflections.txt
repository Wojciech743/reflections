When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

For collaborative, open source work and projects which I wish to show to eventual employers.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

You might not always want the latest version, you also don't want
to get your work destroyed if a new commit comes on remote repository
and overwrites yours.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

Fork is a clone from github profile to another github profile that
references the fact that it's forked and increases fork count of original
creator. Branch is something else entirely.
