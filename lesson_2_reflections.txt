What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

A .git file is created which stores metadata about a repository, without it
git wouldn't be able to track history.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

Unlike working directory and repository, staging area is conceptual
and temporary, it allows for better control over which files and when
to include in a repository and commits.
