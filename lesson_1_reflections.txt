How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that was introduced?

I can see only lines which could cause
the issue, not includingg all others.
It would take a lot less time to find
the bug, I would also know which lines
were added and which were removed
narrowing down the issue source.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more efficient programmer in the long term?

It would save a lot of time which you would normally
spend on saving and cataloging different versions.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google Docs does?

A major con is a human error, forgetting to commit
at the right time could seriously hurt your work,
also a risk of a technical issue such as sudden lack
of electricity destroying your work. Pros is absolute control
over commits.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

Because git is for programmers so multiple files often have to work together
as one system, unlikely google doc where files are mostly unrelated.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

By using them with IDs of commits as arguments.

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that could break something?

Possibility of an easy rollback allows for confident experimenting.

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

For my project, I didn't bother setting the workspace up, because I'm using
another terminal instead of git bash and running git commands there.
